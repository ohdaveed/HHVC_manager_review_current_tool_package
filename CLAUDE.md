# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A static, no-framework mockup tool for manager review of a redesigned HHVC
(Healthy Housing and Vector Control) section of SF.gov. There is no backend,
database, or external service — `index.html` loads plain `<script>` tags
directly, and a single static server (`server.ts`) is the entire runtime.
Bun is used for the dev server and CLI scripts (validate/export/build), not
for a bundler or framework.

A separate Vite sub-app lives at `forms/mosquito-workshop-request/` (a real
build step, built independently — see Build outputs below).

## Commands

```bash
bun install                # install deps (required before first `dev` — index.html
                            # links node_modules/@sfgov/design-system CSS directly)
bun run dev                 # dev server with --watch at http://127.0.0.1:8080
bun run start               # dev server without --watch
bun run validate            # Zod-validate pages/*.js + js/page-data.js
bun run export              # regenerate data/page_inventory.{json,csv}
bun run build                # validate -> export -> build:workshop-form -> build-single-file.js
bun run build:workshop-form  # npm install + vite build inside forms/mosquito-workshop-request
bun run build:netlify        # validate.js -> build-netlify-dist.js (assembles dist/ for Netlify)
bun run format               # prettier --write on **/*.{js,ts,json,md,css,html}
bun run format:check         # prettier --check (this is the lint step; no ESLint/tsc)
```

`HOST=0.0.0.0 bun run dev` / `PORT=3000 bun run dev` override the dev server bind.
`start-dev.sh` kills any stale listener on the port before starting.

**There is no unit-test suite.** `bun run validate` (`build_scripts/validate.js`)
is the de-facto test: it loads every `pages/*.js` file plus `js/page-data.js`
into a Node VM context and Zod-validates required fields/shapes, plus a few
hardcoded invariants (see below). It always validates the full page set —
there's no way to validate a single page file in isolation. Run it after
editing anything under `pages/` or `js/page-data.js`.

## Architecture

### Data-driven rendering, no framework

Each file in `pages/*.js` assigns a page object onto the global
`window.HHVC_PAGES['<pageKey>']`. `js/page-data.js` then builds
`window.HHVC_DATA = { pages, order }`, where `order` is the array of
`[pageKey, menuLabel]` pairs driving navigation/menu order.

**Script load order in `index.html` matters** — these are classic `<script>`
tags sharing one global lexical scope (not ES modules), so `const`/`let`
declared in an earlier file are visible to files loaded after it:

```
js/utils.js → pages/*.js (each page) → js/page-data.js → js/state.js →
js/ui-controls.js → js/editor-panel.js → js/page-render.js → js/app.js →
js/manager-review-export.js → js/ux-improvements.js → js/review-queue.js →
js/dashboard-guidance.js → js/interactive-sitemap.js → js/keyboard-shortcuts.js
```

When adding a new page file, add its `<script>` tag in the `pages/*.js`
block, before `js/page-data.js`. When adding a new `pages/*.js` file, also
add it to the `files` array in `build_scripts/validate.js`.

### Core module split (formerly one `app.js`)

- **`js/utils.js`** — shared helpers (`escapeHtml`, `getPrimaryCta`,
  `setPrimaryCta`, `today`, `csvEscape`, `toCsv`, `downloadFile`, `debounce`,
  `throttle`), exposed as `window.utils` and as bare top-level functions.
  Loads first; add new cross-cutting helpers here rather than duplicating logic.
- **`js/state.js`** — core state: `DATA`/`ORIGINAL_DATA` (a deep clone used
  for field-reset), `pageData`, `pageOrder`, `currentPageKey`. Throws if
  `window.HHVC_DATA` didn't load, which is the fast signal that script order
  in `index.html` broke.
- **`js/ui-controls.js`** — toasts, sidebar collapse/scroll persistence, the
  page-picker `<select>`, and the review checklist.
- **`js/editor-panel.js`** — SEO/editor panel: syncing input fields with the
  current page, dirty-state indicators, search-result preview, per-field reset.
- **`js/page-render.js`** — turns `pages/*.js` page objects into the `#mockPage`
  HTML, including `karlTag()` for Karl CMS placement annotations.
- **`js/app.js`** — bootstraps DOM event listeners (`init()`) and kicks off
  the first `renderPage('pestsTopic')`.
- **`js/manager-review-export.js`** — manager review CSV/JSON export
  snapshot; monkey-patches `renderPage` to refresh the review page label
  after render (handles the case where `renderPage` returns a Promise under
  View Transitions).

### Review/UX layers are additive, on top of the core

`js/ux-improvements.js` (sticky review bar, workspace tabs, Karl compliance
scorecard), `js/review-queue.js` (cross-page review queue/progress),
`js/dashboard-guidance.js` (consolidates sidebar helper copy into the Help
workspace tab, hiding duplicated sidebar text at runtime without deleting
HTML), `js/interactive-sitemap.js` (clickable sitemap reading from
`HHVC_DATA`, lazy-rendered when the Sitemap tab opens), and
`js/keyboard-shortcuts.js` (global shortcuts, ignored while typing in form
fields) are each self-contained IIFEs that read `window.HHVC_DATA` and
`localStorage` but **must not mutate page source data** — they are review
aids only, not publishing tools.

### Page object shape and validation rules

See `build_scripts/validate.js` for the enforced Zod schema: `slug`, `type`
(`Topic page` | `Transaction` | `Information`), `title`, `summary`,
`audience[]`, `reading` (grade-level string), and `sections[]`. Sections
carry `cards[]` and/or `steps[]`; steps can have `bullets`, `callout`, and
`button` (the primary CTA). Optional SEO/review fields: `seoTitle`,
`metaDescription`, `primaryCta`, `editorNote`.

Beyond schema shape, `validate.js` enforces business invariants:
- The `pestsTopic` key must exist and must be first in `order` (it's a Topic
  page, not the old Agency-page section it replaced).
- The old `agency` key must **not** be present.
- Every `card.target` must resolve to a real page key.
- The Topic page's content must not contain banned out-of-scope terms
  (`plumbing`, `dbi`, `roof leak`, `sewer`, `permit issue`,
  `construction defect`) — HHVC scope is Article 11 only.

**`karl` fields are first-class content, not comments** — every card, step,
section, and callout can carry a `karl` string, a placement/rationale note
surfaced to reviewers via `karlTag()` in `js/page-render.js`. Keep these
accurate when editing page copy.

### Local persistence (browser-only, no server-side state)

All reviewer state (decisions, notes, edited SEO fields, workspace UI prefs)
is saved client-side under the versioned `localStorage` key
`hhvcManagerReviewState:v1`. Bump the version suffix if the persisted shape
changes incompatibly. Workspace UI prefs (`workspace_open`, `workspace_tab`,
`last_page_key`, `show_karl_tags`) live under `state.ui` in the same blob.

### Build outputs

- **`build_scripts/build-single-file.js`** inlines `index.html`'s local
  stylesheets and scripts (in document order) into
  `manager-review-single-file.html` and `single-file-export-current-source.html`.
  These, plus `data/page_inventory.{json,csv}`, are gitignored generated
  files — **never hand-edit them**; edit sources and re-run `bun run build`.
- **`build_scripts/extract-pages.js`** (`bun run export`) regenerates
  `data/page_inventory.{json,csv}` from page data. `data/` is absent on a
  fresh clone (gitignored); this script creates it. Dev/serve never touches
  `data/` — only build/export does.
- **`build_scripts/build-netlify-dist.js`** (`bun run build:netlify`, driven
  by `netlify.toml`) assembles `dist/` with only runtime files: `index.html`,
  `css/`, `js/`, `pages/`, the three `@sfgov/design-system` CSS files
  (referenced by `index.html` via `node_modules` paths, so `npm install`/`bun
  install` must run first), and the compiled `forms/mosquito-workshop-request/dist`
  (that Vite sub-app is built with `base: '/forms/mosquito-workshop-request/'`,
  so its output is copied to that same path under `dist/`).
- `server.ts` mirrors the same security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `X-Frame-Options`, etc.) that `netlify.toml` sets for the deployed site.

### Other directories

- **`forms/mosquito-workshop-request/`** — an independent Vite app (own
  `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `src/main.js`) for one embedded form. Not
  wired into the main Bun dev server; built separately via
  `bun run build:workshop-form` or the Netlify build.
- **`review/`** — reference/output for the manager review process
  (`manager_review_packet.md`, `manager_decision_log.csv`,
  `page_approval_checklist.csv`), distinct from the in-browser
  `localStorage` review state.
- **`docs/source/hhvc-policy/`** — source policy documents (PDFs and their
  markdown extracts) that page copy is based on; not code.
- **`docs/superpowers/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/specs/`** — planning and
  design docs from prior work sessions; useful background, not standing
  instructions.
- **`.playwright-mcp/`** — scratch console logs/snapshots from prior
  Playwright MCP sessions; not part of the source.

## Editing rules

- Edit public page content in `pages/*.js`.
- Edit core render/state behavior in `js/state.js`, `js/page-render.js`,
  `js/ui-controls.js`, `js/editor-panel.js`, and `js/app.js`.
- Edit review/UX layers in `js/ux-improvements.js`, `js/review-queue.js`,
  `js/dashboard-guidance.js`, `js/interactive-sitemap.js`,
  `js/keyboard-shortcuts.js`, `js/manager-review-export.js`, and
  `css/ux-improvements.css`.
- Edit styles in `css/styles.css`; `css/theme.css` holds SFDS design-token
  overrides layered under the `@sfgov/design-system` stylesheets.
- Review exports (`review/*.csv`, saved local-review CSV/JSON) are for
  manager decisions only — never treat them as automatic publication approval.

## Code style

Enforced by Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`): no semicolons, single quotes,
2-space indentation, 100-character print width, ES5 trailing commas. Run
`bun run format` before committing. `.prettierignore` excludes `data/`,
`server.ts`, and the generated single-file HTML exports.

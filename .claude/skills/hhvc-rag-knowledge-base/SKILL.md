description: HHVC repo: the compliance-audit RAG feature — docs/source corpus ingestion, chunking, Gemini-only embeddings, brute-force cosine retrieval, and citation validation against the retrieved set. Load before editing build_scripts/knowledge-*.js, build_scripts/ai/compliance-audit.js, or ingest-knowledge.js.

# RAG knowledge base (optional)

`compliance-audit` is a second `/api/ai/generate` task alongside `content`: a
grounded compliance audit of the open page, citing this repo's own
`docs/source/` corpus instead of the model's unaided judgment. Same posture as
the rest of the AI backend — additive, off unless configured, fails closed,
never writes anything, and every result carries the same `disclosure` string.

- **Corpus is `docs/source/**/*.md`, `README.md` excluded, publication status
  not filtered.** `build_scripts/ingest-knowledge.js` globs the whole tree
  except folder-index `README.md` files — including the one file named
  `DRAFT-NOT-FOR-PUBLICATION`, on an explicit reviewer decision. The
  alternative was the ingestion script silently deciding what counts as
  citable, which is the failure mode this feature exists to avoid.
- **One new table, same database as `review_pages`.** `knowledge_chunks`
  lives in the same `DATA_DB_PATH` SQLite file — one connection, one volume —
  rather than a second DB to configure. `build_scripts/knowledge-schema.js` is
  the single table definition shared by the write path
  (`build_scripts/ingest-knowledge.js`) and the read path
  (`build_scripts/ai/knowledge-retrieval.js`), so the two processes cannot
  disagree on the schema, and ingestion never assumes the server ran first.
- **Chunking splits on headings, then on size.**
  `build_scripts/knowledge-chunking.js` splits on `##`/`###` headings, then
  sub-splits anything over 500 words at paragraph boundaries with a 50-word
  overlap, and prefixes every chunk with its heading path before embedding —
  so a boundary fact keeps its context and a chunk carries its own section
  location with no join back to the source file needed.
- **Embeddings are Gemini-only** — Anthropic has no embeddings API — so
  `compliance-audit` needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` even on a deployment generating
  with Claude. Default model `gemini-embedding-001`, overridable via
  `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. (Was `text-embedding-004` until a real `bun run
ingest` run 404'd on it — retired; verify against `client.models.list()`
  filtered to `embedContent` support, not a doc example, before trusting any
  hardcoded id here again.)
- **Retrieval is brute-force cosine similarity in JS, not a vector-index
  extension.** `build_scripts/knowledge-search.js` ranks the full corpus
  (~150-200 chunks) by cosine similarity in microseconds at this size; a
  loadable extension like `sqlite-vec` would buy nothing here and adds a
  native-binary deployment risk against Railway for no benefit. Dual-exported
  like `js/review-merge.js`, so ranking is tested against synthetic embeddings
  with no live Gemini call and no live DB.
- **Re-ingestion is idempotent per file, and always full.** `bun run ingest`
  deletes and reinserts each file's rows in one transaction, reprocessing
  every file on every run rather than diffing — so a re-run after editing
  `docs/source/` or changing `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` is always safe, and no
  stale mix of two embedding models can accumulate. Manual, like
  `bun run export` — not part of `bun run build`, since it needs a real
  (billed) Gemini call CI must not make.
- **`GET /api/ai/capabilities` reports `knowledgeBase: {ready, chunkCount}`**
  so the browser can distinguish "no Gemini key" from "key present, nobody's
  run `bun run ingest` yet" — different states, different copy.
- **Citations are checked against the retrieved set, not accepted as free
  text.** Findings cite chunk ids (`${source_file}#${chunk_index}`), not a
  restated source/heading — the failure mode this guards against is a
  plausible-sounding citation that was never actually retrieved.
  `build_scripts/ai/validate-compliance-audit.js`'s `findInvalidCitations()`
  checks every cited id against what was retrieved for that request, and
  rejects an empty `citedChunkIds` too. A bad citation triggers one retry
  naming the specific finding and id; a finding still bad after that retry is
  returned anyway (same "always resolves with the draft" rule as `content`)
  but flagged `valid: false` with the bad id in `issues`. The
  `source_file`/`heading_path` shown to a reviewer is resolved server-side
  from the matched row, never echoed from the model.
- **The route gates on knowledge-base readiness separately from the generic
  no-provider gate.** `hasConfiguredProvider()` still gates first, same as
  `content`; past that, `compliance-audit` checks Gemini-configured **and**
  `knowledge_chunks` non-empty, answering 501 with which half is missing.
  `generateComplianceAudit()` (`build_scripts/ai/compliance-audit.js`) is a
  sibling to `generateContent()`, not a generalization of it — its own retry
  loop, rather than bending the existing task's machinery to fit a second,
  structurally different validator.
- **Never writes anything**, same as `content` — no filesystem, no
  review-state write, no `pages/*.js` mutation, and every successful audit
  carries the same `disclosure` string for the same §1.11/AI-disclosure
  reasons.
- Full design rationale, including what was deliberately left out (a
  corpus-wide embedding-model table, a task-dispatching registry refactor of
  `generateContent()`), is in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-rag-knowledge-base-design.md`.

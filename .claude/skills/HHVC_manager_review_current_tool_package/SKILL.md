## What this repo is

A static, **no-framework** mockup tool for manager review of a redesigned HHVC
section of SF.gov. `index.html` loads plain classic `<script>` tags directly —
**this is plain browser JavaScript, not TypeScript**; there is no bundler and no
ES modules/`import`/`export` in `js/*.js`. **Bun** runs the dev server, CLI
scripts, and tests.

## Coding conventions

- **Formatting (CI gate):** Prettier only (`.prettierrc.json`) — no semicolons,
  single quotes, 2-space indent, 100-char width, ES5 trailing commas. Code must be
  ASI-safe. Run `bun run format` before committing.
- **File naming:** lowercase filenames — single words for the core modules
  (`app.js`, `state.js`, `utils.js`) and hyphenated for multi-word ones
  (`review-queue-state.js`, `page-render.js`); never camelCase. Match the sibling
  files in whatever directory you're in.
- **No imports/exports.** Modules are either (1) bare top-level `const`/`function`
  sharing one global lexical scope via ordered `<script>` tags, or (2) **named
  IIFEs with a leading semicolon** — `;(function mountX(){…})()` — exposing an API
  on `window.<Namespace>` via the idempotent `window.X = window.X || {}` idiom.
- **Naming:** `camelCase` JS identifiers, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` module constants,
  `snake_case` serialized/CSV data fields.
- **Defensive by default:** `escapeHtml` everything reaching `innerHTML`; optional
  chaining + `?? ''`; guard-clause early returns; reuse `js/utils.js` helpers.
- **Comments:** write detailed, explanatory comments that justify the _why_ and
  note load-order dependencies — not terse restatements of code.

## Testing

- Framework is **Bun test**: `const { describe, test, expect } = require('bun:test')`.
  Tests live in `tests/*.test.js`; a `tests/helpers/load-scripts.js` harness
  evaluates the classic `<script>` files. Playwright e2e lives in `tests/e2e/`.
- Name `describe` after the unit; write `test` names as behavioral verb sentences.
  Prefer exact-string assertions; use `test.todo` (with a comment) for known bugs.
- Run `bun run test` and `bun run validate` after editing `pages/*.js` or
  `js/page-data.js`.

## Key workflows

- **Edit page content** in `pages/*.js` (one `window.HHVC_PAGES['key'] = {…}`
  assignment). Keep `karl` annotation fields accurate — they're first-class
  content, not comments. When adding a page, also add its `<script>` tag to
  `index.html` and an `order` entry in `js/page-data.js`.
- **Never hand-edit generated files** (single-file HTML exports,
  `data/page_inventory.*`) — edit sources and re-run `bun run build`.
- **Keep dashboard-UX and policy-copy changes in separate PRs.**
